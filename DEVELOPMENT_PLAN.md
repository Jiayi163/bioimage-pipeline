# Development Plan

This project is a lightweight Python bioimage analysis package inspired by
Fiji/ImageJ and CellProfiler. It does not import or copy code from either
project.

Work should proceed phase by phase. Do not implement later phases until the
current phase has tests and passes its self-check.

## Phase Workflow

For every phase:

1. Implement the smallest working version.
2. Add or update pytest tests.
3. Review the code.
4. Check for missing imports, wrong paths, unclear names, inconsistent return
   types, shape errors, dtype problems, TIFF saving issues, CSV export issues,
   and overly complicated functions.
5. Fix problems found during review.
6. Summarize what was implemented.
7. List the exact terminal command to test it.
8. Mark the phase as `PHASE COMPLETE` or `PHASE NOT COMPLETE`.

## Phase 0: Project Setup

Goal: create the project structure and packaging files.

Tasks:

- Create the `bioimage_pipeline` package.
- Create `examples/` and `tests/`.
- Create `pyproject.toml`.
- Add dependencies.
- Add `README.md`.
- Add `.gitignore`.
- Do not implement full functionality yet.

Self-check:

- Can the package be imported?
- Does the folder structure match the plan?
- Does pytest run without import errors?

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 1: Fiji-Style TIFF Input/Output

Goal: implement TIFF reading and writing.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/io.py`
- `tests/test_io.py`

Functions:

- `read_tiff(path) -> numpy.ndarray`
- `save_tiff(path, image) -> None`

Requirements:

- Use `tifffile`.
- Use `pathlib.Path`.
- Accept string or `Path` input.
- Raise clear errors for missing files.
- Preserve image shape.
- Save masks as TIFF-compatible arrays.

Self-check:

- Can it read a TIFF?
- Can it save a TIFF?
- Can Fiji open the saved TIFF?
- Does dtype stay reasonable?
- Are errors understandable?

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 2: Basic Preprocessing

Goal: implement simple preprocessing filters.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/preprocess.py`
- `tests/test_preprocess.py`

Functions:

- `gaussian_blur(image, sigma=1)`
- `median_filter_image(image, radius=1)`
- `normalize_image(image)`

Requirements:

- Preserve image shape.
- Avoid modifying input image in place.
- Return NumPy arrays.
- Keep functions small.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 3: Basic Thresholding

Goal: implement thresholding methods without advanced adaptive logic.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/threshold.py`
- `tests/test_threshold.py`

Functions:

- `manual_threshold(image, value) -> bool mask`
- `otsu_threshold(image) -> bool mask`
- `adaptive_threshold(image, block_size=51, offset=0) -> bool mask`

Requirements:

- Use `scikit-image`.
- Always return boolean masks.
- Preserve image shape.
- Handle invalid `block_size` clearly.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 4: Segmentation

Goal: convert binary masks into labeled objects.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** binary mask cleanup before analysis (no GUI).
- **CellProfiler:** simplified IdentifyPrimaryObjects (cleanup + labeling).

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/segment.py`
- `tests/test_segment.py`

Inputs / outputs:

- Input: `bool` mask `(H, W)`.
- Output: cleaned `bool` mask; labeled `int` image with background `0`.

Tasks:

- Implement `remove_small_objects_from_mask(mask, min_size=20)`.
- Implement `label_objects(mask)` with `skimage.measure.label`.
- Support 2D only; raise `ValueError` for non-2D masks.

Acceptance tests:

- Label `0` is background.
- Objects have unique integer labels.
- Tiny noise objects are removed.
- Returned label image is integer type.

Fiji visual check: deferred until Phase 6 export.

Deferred: 3D volumes, watershed splitting, GUI.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 5: Measurement

Goal: measure segmented objects.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** Analyze Particles–style region properties (via scikit-image).
- **CellProfiler:** MeasureObjectIntensity / region props table.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/measure.py`
- `tests/test_measure.py`

Inputs / outputs:

- Input: `labels` `(H, W)` int; optional `intensity_image` (original, not mask).
- Output: `pandas.DataFrame` with one row per object.
- Pipeline dict key: `"measurements"`.

Tasks:

- Implement `measure_objects(label_image, intensity_image=None)`.
- Use `skimage.measure.regionprops_table`.
- Columns: `label`, `area`, `centroid`, `bbox`; add `mean_intensity`, `max_intensity` when intensity provided.

Acceptance tests:

- One row per object.
- Area values are reasonable.
- Intensity columns use `intensity_image`, not the mask.

Deferred: custom measurement plugins, 3D props.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 6: Export

Goal: export masks, labeled images, and measurements for Fiji and spreadsheets.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** save masks and label images as TIFF for visual inspection.
- **CellProfiler:** export measurements to CSV.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/export.py`
- `tests/test_export.py`

Inputs / outputs:

- `export_mask_tiff(path, mask)` — bool mask → `uint8` 0/255 TIFF.
- `export_label_tiff(path, labels)` — integer label TIFF.
- `export_measurements_csv(path, dataframe)` — Excel-friendly CSV.

Tasks:

- Reuse `save_tiff` from `io.py` where appropriate.
- Create parent directories automatically.

Acceptance tests:

- Mask TIFF dtype `uint8`, values 0 or 255.
- Label TIFF preserves integer labels.
- CSV round-trip readable.

Fiji visual check: mask and label TIFFs open in Fiji without error.

Deferred: ROI sets, multi-channel stacks.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 7: Pipeline Core

Goal: implement a simple CellProfiler-style pipeline system.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** N/A (macro chaining is separate).
- **CellProfiler:** ordered modules sharing an image workspace.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/pipeline.py`
- `tests/test_pipeline.py`

Inputs / outputs:

- Shared dict, e.g. `image`, `processed`, `mask`, `labels`, `measurements`, `filename`.
- Each step: `Callable[[dict], dict]`.

Tasks:

- Implement `Pipeline` with `__init__(steps)` and `run(data)`.
- Run steps in order; clear errors on bad return types.

Acceptance tests:

- Later steps see keys from earlier steps.
- Non-dict return raises `TypeError`.
- Step exception wraps as `RuntimeError` with step index.

Deferred: parallel runs, module GUI, branching logic.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 8: Batch Processing

Goal: run the pipeline on a folder of TIFF images.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** N/A (batch via scripts).
- **CellProfiler:** batch mode over image folders.

Files:

- `bioimage_pipeline/batch.py`
- `tests/test_batch.py`

Function:

- `run_pipeline_on_folder(pipeline, input_folder, output_folder, pattern="*.tif")`

Tasks:

- Discover TIFF files (`*.tif` and `*.tiff`).
- Per image: run pipeline, save mask/labels/measurements.
- Add `filename` column to measurements.
- Return `processed` and `failed` lists; do not stop on single failure.

Acceptance tests:

- Multiple files processed.
- Outputs named by image stem.
- Combined CSV optional; failures reported.

Deferred: distributed cluster batch, database output.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 9: Example Workflow

Goal: create one runnable beginner-friendly example.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** inspect outputs after running a script.
- **CellProfiler:** single-image analysis pipeline template.

File:

- `examples/run_basic_pipeline.py`

Workflow:

1. Read TIFF (or generate synthetic image).
2. Gaussian blur → Otsu threshold → remove small objects → label → measure.
3. Export mask TIFF, label TIFF, measurements CSV.

Tasks:

- Clear variable names and comments.
- No real lab data required.

Acceptance tests:

- Script runs from terminal without error.
- Output files exist in a chosen output directory.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 10: Visual Check Without GUI

Goal: create a simple visual validation script without building a GUI.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** manual QC of masks and labels.
- **CellProfiler:** N/A.

File:

- `examples/visual_check.py`

Requirements:

- Synthetic image with bright circles and noise.
- Save original, mask, labels, CSV.
- Print: `Open the output TIFF files in Fiji to visually inspect the result.`

Acceptance tests:

- All expected output files created.
- Script exits successfully from terminal.

Fiji visual check: user opens TIFFs in Fiji.

Status: `PHASE COMPLETE` ✔

## Phase 11: Advanced / Self-Adaptive Thresholding (Future)

Goal: document future threshold improvements; do not implement until Phases 4–10 are complete.

Inspiration:

- **Fiji:** Auto Threshold, rolling-ball background correction.
- **CellProfiler:** advanced threshold modules.

Deferred examples:

- Auto-tuned block size / offset.
- Rolling-ball or morphological background subtraction before threshold.
- Multi-scale or learned thresholds.

Status: `PHASE NOT COMPLETE` (future — not started)
